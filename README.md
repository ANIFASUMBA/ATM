A C++ ATM program is a console-based simulation that mimics the basic operations of an Automated Teller Machine(ATM). 
It’s a great beginner-to-intermediate project that demonstrates object-oriented programming, control structures, and user input handling.
ATM shows all bank transactions without necessity of going to a bank.
IT implements a secure, user-friendly system that lets bank customers perform cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, deposits, PIN management, and view transaction history without teller assistance. 
Core goals are reliability, transaction integrity, and clear user interaction flow
