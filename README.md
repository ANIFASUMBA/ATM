A C++ ATM program is a console-based simulation that mimics the basic operations of an Automated Teller Machine(ATM). 
It’s a great beginner-to-intermediate project that demonstrates object-oriented programming, control structures, and user input handling.
ATM shows all bank transactions without necessity of going to a bank.
